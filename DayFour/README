This repo demonstrates sorting with java arraylists
	- Runner class is the main class that has a method to 
	generate numbers from 0 to the given size
	- Instantiate an object from the other classes
	(Selection, Insertion, Merge or Quick) and call the 
	sort method by passing the generated arraylist.
